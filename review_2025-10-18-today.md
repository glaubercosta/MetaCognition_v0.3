# Code Review — 2025-10-18 (Changes of the day)

## Scope
This review covers commits made on 2025-10-18: hashes 9a3b900, 863f50e, da38ff2, a81453c. It focuses on behavior, architecture, tests, and risks introduced by today's changes.

## Summary of changes
- Orchestration engines: added CrewAI real adapter (httpx), feature flagging, duration_ms, and structured JSON logs.
- Multipart import validation and UI stub for file upload.
- Fake engine + contract tests to validate engine contract.
- Documentation updates and changelog entries for Sprint 2.
- Created backup and preserved `resumo-executivo.md`.

## Positives
- Clear progression on orchestration features; adding a real CrewAI adapter is a necessary next step.
- Good unit/contract tests added for engine behavior (keeps regressions low).
- Structured JSON logs and duration metrics improve observability.
- Multipart import validation improves robustness for large payloads.
- Tests kept green; CI lint & coverage adjustments show attention to quality.

## Issues and Risks
1. Binary and pycache files committed
   - Several `__pycache__/*.pyc` files and generated `public/assets` files are present in the tree and mentioned in diffs. These should not be committed; add to `.gitignore` and remove from history if necessary.

2. Frontend build artifacts in `public/`
   - The `public/` folder contains built assets. If `frontend/` is the source, prefer keeping build artifacts out of main branch or mark them explicitly as release artifacts. Consider adding a release step that commits built assets to a release branch only.

3. Potential config leakage
   - Check that no secrets or credentials were added to `app/config.py` or `README.md` accidentally during updates.

4. Inconsistent repo layout referenced in `resumo-executivo.md`
   - The `resumo-executivo.md` references `frontend/` and `public/` structures; ensure they match actual repo layout (`ui/public/` vs `frontend/`) to avoid confusion.

5. Tests and coverage
   - While tests exist and pass locally, ensure CI runs them. Some tests use HTTP mocking and could be brittle; add explicit timeouts and deterministic data.

## Recommendations (Immediate)
- Remove `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files from the repo and add appropriate `.gitignore` entries:

  git rm -r --cached __pycache__
  git commit -m "chore: remove pycache files"

  Add to `.gitignore`:
  __pycache__/
  *.py[cod]

- Move built frontend artifacts out of source branches or place the source `frontend/` beside `ui/` and standardize the build path.
- Add `public/assets` to `.gitignore` if builds are not meant to be versioned.
- Run `git status` and `git clean -ndX` to preview removable files before deleting.

## Recommendations (Medium)
- Add CI job to fail on committed build artifacts or large binary files.
- Add an integration test that performs a minimal end-to-end flow (create agent → create flow → run orchestration) using an in-memory DB.
- Ensure logging uses structured fields and a consistent schema; provide a small spec for logs (timestamp, engine, duration_ms, status, request_id).

## Action Items (PRs)
1. PR: Cleanup repo — remove pyc and large built assets, update `.gitignore`
2. PR: Standardize frontend source and build path; add Makefile target to build+copy to `ui/public`
3. PR: Add CI check for large files and pycache
4. PR: Add E2E smoke test and extend current contract tests to cover failure modes

## Conclusion
Today's changes move the project forward on orchestration and observability, but introduce repository hygiene issues (build artifacts, pyc). Fixing these quickly will keep the codebase healthy and make future UI work smoother.
